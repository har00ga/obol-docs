:::caution

The `charon` client is under heavy development, interfaces are subject to change until a first major version is published. 

:::

The following is a reference for charon version [`0.1.1`](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/releases/tag/v0.1.1). Find the latest release on [our Github](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/releases).

Usage:
  charon [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  enr         Return this node's ENR
  help        Help about any command
  run         Runs the Charon middleware
  version     Print version and exit

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for charon
